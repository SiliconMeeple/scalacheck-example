# Introduction to property based testing

This is an [activator](https://typesafe.com/activator) tutorial to support a property based testing workshop at the [Scala Exchange 2015](http://scala.exchange).

If you plan to attend the workshop, please clone the repository and run:

```
sbt test
```

After successfully downloading the necessary libraries, it should fail to run the tests because of missing implementations.

Please use the [gitter chatroom](https://gitter.im/HolyHaddock/scalacheck-example) for the project, or contact me via gmail or twitter if there is trouble downloading scalacheck.

There are likely to be updates between today and the workshop, but the libraries being used should not change, so running this now will save time and wi-fi on the day.

## REPL

To get started interactively investigating the scalacheck library, this project sets some default imports to get you startedin  the powerful [Ammonite REPL](https://lihaoyi.github.io/Ammonite/#Ammonite-REPL) just by running:

```
   sbt test:console
```

## Slides

Slides that accompany the session can be found [here](https://goo.gl/zytQHm) (it's on a free heroku dyno, so may take a while to respond the first time).

## Solutions

Solutions to the exercises can be found by checking out the answers branch.
